# A Guide to PHP User Groups

User Groups are the most amazing resource for learning, networking, having fun and generally moving your career forward. 

## How do I find my UG?

Easy! Check out https://php.ug/

You can then find the closest group to you and figure out how often they meet. The rest is even easier, go hang out, have a drink, talk shop and make new friends, and who knows, meet new co-workers.

## There is no group near me, what now?

_Paragraph 1, article 1 of the "Cal Evans' rule of UGs":_ **"If there is no User Group in your area, you are it."**

Have you considered starting your own User Group?
Its surely a fair amount of work, but experience has shown it can be made easier the more people you find, its also a thankless job that can pay off a lot in market recognition and networking.
